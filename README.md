## Projects

### HostFixture
https://github.com/PatchworkHorse/HostFixture

HostFixture is a test fixturing framework intended to bring integration tests closer to the "Real" thing. HostFixture is designed to work with any IHostBuilder implementation and, among other things allows you to: 
- Manipulate IConfiguration values
- Replace ServiceCollection registrations (i.e., with mocks)
- Add programmable HTTP interceptors to log, alter, or mock HttpRequest and HttpResponse messages. 
- Intercept, alter, mock integrations with various Microsoft Azure services. 

### DistributedTranscoder
https://github.com/PatchworkHorse/DistributedTranscoder

Learning project as part of learning Golang & gRPC as well as sharpening containerization skills. DistributedTranscoder is intended to perform transcoding operations on video in a distributed, platform-agnostic manner using cheap cloud resources. 

- Accept incoming video (blobs for now, streams later) and break it into configurable chunks, drop chunks into an S3 bucket. 
- Orchestrate operations on containerized workers. Currently workers use FFmpeg for transcoding and other manipulation tasks
- Re-assemble transcoded chunks into useful output
